# Frontend Deployment - Next Steps

## Current Status

The frontend is now accessible at http://128.251.177.242 using a temporary Nginx demo image. This confirms that:

1. The Kubernetes service is working correctly
2. The external IP is accessible
3. The LoadBalancer is properly configured

## Next Steps

To deploy your actual frontend application, follow these steps:

### 1. Fix ACR Authentication Issues

The main issue preventing your frontend from being deployed was authentication with Azure Container Registry (ACR). To fix this:

```bash
# Create an ACR authentication secret
./scripts/deployment/create-acr-secret.sh <registry> <secret-name> <namespace>
```

Make sure your AKS cluster has the proper permissions to pull images from ACR. You can grant these permissions using:

```bash
az aks update -n <aks-cluster> -g <resource-group> --attach-acr <registry>
```

### 2. Update Your Frontend Image

Once ACR authentication is fixed, you can update your frontend image:

```bash
# Build and push your frontend image to ACR
./scripts/deployment/fix-frontend-deployment.sh <resource-group> <aks-cluster> <registry>
```

### 3. Update Your Kubernetes Deployment

Make sure your Kubernetes deployment includes the imagePullSecrets:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: acr-auth
```

### 4. Test Your Frontend

After deploying your actual frontend, test it to make sure it's working correctly:

```bash
./scripts/deployment/check-frontend.sh
./scripts/testing/test-frontend.sh <frontend-url>
```

## Alternative Solutions

If you continue to have issues with ACR, consider these alternative solutions:

### 1. Use Docker Hub

You can use Docker Hub instead of ACR:

```bash
./scripts/deployment/fix-frontend-dockerhub.sh <your-dockerhub-username>
```

### 2. Use a Local Image

If you're running Kubernetes locally (e.g., with minikube), you can use a local image:

```bash
./scripts/deployment/fix-frontend-local.sh
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. ImagePullBackOff

If you see `ImagePullBackOff` errors, it's usually due to authentication issues. Make sure you've created the ACR authentication secret and added it to your deployment.

### 2. White Screen

If you're seeing a white screen, check the following:

- Check the frontend logs: `kubectl logs deployment/frontend`
- Check if the API Gateway is accessible from the frontend
- Check the browser console for any errors

### 3. MIME Type Issues

If you're seeing MIME type errors in the browser console, make sure your Nginx configuration is correctly set up to serve JavaScript and CSS files with the proper MIME types.

## CI/CD Integration

To integrate these fixes into your CI/CD pipeline:

1. Add a step to create the ACR authentication secret
2. Update your deployment YAML files to include the imagePullSecrets
3. Add tests to verify that the frontend is working correctly
