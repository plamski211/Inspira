# Urgent Frontend Fixes

This document explains the urgent fixes for the frontend white screen issues in both Azure and Docker Compose environments.

## 1. Azure Cloud Frontend Fix (IP starting with 4.x.x.x)

### Problem

When accessing the Azure cloud frontend through the public IP (starting with 4.x.x.x), the frontend displays a white screen or doesn't show up at all.

### Solution

We've created an urgent fix script (`scripts/deployment/fix-azure-frontend-urgent.sh`) that:

1. Creates a completely new frontend deployment using a simple static HTML page
2. Sets up proper Nginx configuration with correct MIME types
3. Configures proper API Gateway proxying
4. Ensures all necessary configuration is mounted as ConfigMaps

To apply this fix:

```bash
./scripts/deployment/fix-azure-frontend-urgent.sh
```

This script will:
- Create all necessary ConfigMaps
- Deploy a new frontend with a simple static HTML page
- Delete any existing pods to force a new deployment
- Wait for the deployment to be ready
- Display the frontend URL

## 2. Docker Compose Frontend Fix

### Problem

When running the application with Docker Compose, the frontend displays a white screen in various parts of the application, including after login and on profile pages.

### Solution

We've created an urgent fix script (`scripts/deployment/fix-docker-compose-urgent.sh`) that:

1. Creates a completely new frontend using a simple static HTML page
2. Sets up proper Nginx configuration with correct MIME types
3. Configures proper API Gateway proxying
4. Creates a new Docker Compose file with the simplified frontend

To apply this fix:

```bash
./scripts/deployment/fix-docker-compose-urgent.sh
```

This script will:
- Create a simple frontend with a static HTML page
- Build a Docker image for the frontend
- Create a new Docker Compose file
- Stop the current Docker Compose setup
- Start the new Docker Compose setup with the simplified frontend

## Troubleshooting

### If You Still See White Screens

If you're still experiencing white screens after applying these fixes:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear your browser cache completely to ensure you're getting the latest version of the application.
2. **Try Incognito Mode**: Try accessing the frontend in an incognito/private window to avoid any cached content.
3. **Check Logs**: Check the frontend logs to see if there are any errors:
   - Azure: `kubectl logs deployment/frontend`
   - Docker Compose: `docker-compose logs frontend`
4. **Check API Gateway**: Make sure the API Gateway is running and accessible:
   - Azure: `kubectl get pods | grep api-gateway`
   - Docker Compose: `docker-compose ps api-gateway`
5. **Check Browser Console**: Open your browser's developer tools and check the console for any errors.

### Database Connection Issues

If you're experiencing database connection issues when using pgAdmin:

1. Make sure you're using the correct ports:
   - User Service: Port 5435 (not 5432)
   - Content Service: Port 5433
   - Media Service: Port 5434

2. Use the following connection details:
   - Host: localhost
   - Username: user_user (for User Service), content_user (for Content Service), media_user (for Media Service)
   - Password: user_pw (for User Service), content_pw (for Content Service), media_pw (for Media Service)
   - Database: users (for User Service), content (for Content Service), media (for Media Service)

## Next Steps

These fixes are meant to be temporary solutions to get the application up and running quickly. For a more permanent solution, we recommend:

1. Properly configure the frontend build process to ensure all assets are correctly bundled
2. Set up proper environment configuration for different environments
3. Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. Set up proper monitoring and logging to detect and diagnose issues quickly
