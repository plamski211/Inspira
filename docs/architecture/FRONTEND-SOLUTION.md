# Frontend Deployment Solution

## Problem Summary
The frontend deployment was showing a blank white screen because of MIME type issues. The JavaScript and CSS files were being served with incorrect MIME types, causing the browser to reject executing them.

## Root Causes
1. NGINX configuration in the frontend container didn't properly set MIME types
2. The Kubernetes ingress controller was overriding the MIME types

## Solution

### Option 1: Direct Access (Recommended)
The most reliable way to access the frontend with correct MIME types is to bypass the ingress controller and access the frontend service directly:

```bash
# Run this script to access the frontend directly
./access-frontend.sh
```

This will set up port forwarding and allow you to access the frontend at http://localhost:8080 with all MIME types correctly set.

### Option 2: Fixed Frontend Deployment
We've created a fixed frontend deployment with proper MIME type handling:

```bash
# Run this script to deploy the fixed frontend
./fix-frontend-deployment.sh
```

This script:
1. Creates an optimized Dockerfile with proper MIME type handling
2. Builds and pushes a new Docker image
3. Deploys the fixed frontend to Kubernetes
4. Updates the ingress to point to the fixed frontend

### Option 3: Direct MIME Type Fix
If you want to fix the MIME types in the existing frontend pod:

```bash
# Run this script to fix MIME types in the running pod
./fix-mime-types-in-pod.sh
```

This script directly modifies the NGINX configuration in the running frontend pod to properly handle MIME types.

## User Service

The user service has also been deployed correctly. You can verify it's working with:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n microservices -l app=user-service
```

## Accessing the Application

- Direct access (recommended): http://localhost:8080 (after running ./access-frontend.sh)
- Through ingress: http://4.156.37.48

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check if the frontend pod is running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n microservices -l app=frontend
   ```

2. Check the logs of the frontend pod:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n microservices -l app=frontend
   ```

3. Check the ingress configuration:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe ingress inspira-ingress -n microservices
   ```

4. Use port forwarding to access the frontend directly:
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward -n microservices svc/frontend 8080:80
   ```
