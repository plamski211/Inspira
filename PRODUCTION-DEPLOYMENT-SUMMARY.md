- **User Service**: Accessible at http://4.156.37.48/api/users/

### Production Features Implemented

1. **High Availability**
   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for all services
   - Resource requests and limits defined

2. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Grafana for visualization and dashboards
   - Access Grafana: `./access-grafana.sh` (credentials: admin/prom-operator)

3. **Resource Management**
   - Resource quotas for the microservices namespace
   - CPU and memory limits for all pods

4. **Security**
   - Network policies to restrict traffic between namespaces
   - NGINX Ingress Controller for traffic management

## Accessing the Application

- **Frontend**: http://4.156.37.48/
- **API Gateway**: http://4.156.37.48/api/gateway/
- **User Service**: http://4.156.37.48/api/users/

## Monitoring

To access the Grafana dashboard:
```bash
./access-grafana.sh
```
Then visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser (credentials: admin/prom-operator).

## Deployment Scripts

- **upgrade-to-production.sh**: Script to upgrade to production with SSL/TLS and custom domain
- **build-frontend-prod.sh**: Script to build and push the production frontend image
- **access-grafana.sh**: Script to access the Grafana dashboard

## Next Steps

1. **Custom Domain and SSL/TLS**
   - Purchase a domain name
   - Set up DNS records
   - Install cert-manager and configure SSL/TLS

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated deployments
   - Configure staging and production environments

3. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**
   - Implement Velero for backup and restore
   - Set up scheduled backups

4. **Logging**
   - Implement ELK stack or Loki for centralized logging

5. **Application Improvements**
   - Deploy actual frontend application code
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Set up database services
