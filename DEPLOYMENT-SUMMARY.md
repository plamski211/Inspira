# Deployment Summary

## Status

We have successfully set up the Azure infrastructure for the Inspira project but are encountering image pull issues when deploying the microservices.

### Completed Tasks

1. **Azure Resources**:
   - Created resource group: `inspira-project`
   - Created Azure Container Registry (ACR): `inspiraregistry20250617`
   - Created Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): `inspira-aks` (2 nodes, Standard_B2s)
   - Set up necessary IAM roles and permissions

2. **Container Images**:
   - Built and pushed Docker images to ACR:
     - `api-gateway:latest`
     - `user-service:latest`
     - `frontend:latest`
     - `test:latest`

3. **Kubernetes Setup**:
   - Created `microservices` namespace
   - Created Kubernetes manifests for all services
   - Created secrets for database credentials and ACR authentication
   - Applied manifests to deploy services
   - Verified cluster can pull public images (nginx)

4. **Automation Scripts**:
   - `build-push.sh`: Builds and pushes Docker images to ACR
   - `update-k8s-manifests.sh`: Updates Kubernetes manifests with ACR image references
   - `validate-deployment.sh`: Validates the deployment status
   - `setup-azure-db.sh`: Sets up Azure Database for PostgreSQL

### Current Issues

- **Image Pull Issues**: Pods are unable to pull images from ACR despite multiple authentication attempts
- **Authentication Errors**: Receiving `401 Unauthorized` errors when trying to pull images
- **Platform Compatibility**: Possible platform mismatch between built images and AKS nodes

### Next Steps

1. Implement the solutions outlined in `DEPLOYMENT-TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
2. Complete the deployment of all microservices
3. Set up Azure Application Gateway for ingress
4. Configure SSL/TLS for secure communication
5. Set up monitoring and logging with Azure Monitor
6. Implement CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
