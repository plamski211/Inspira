# Frontend Deployment Success

## Current Status

The Inspira frontend application has been successfully deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and is accessible at http://4.156.37.48/.

## Deployment Details

### Image Information

- **Image**: `pngbanks/frontend:optimized`
- **Base Image**: `nginx:stable-alpine`
- **Architecture**: Multi-platform (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)

### Features

- React application with routing
- Auth0 integration for authentication
- API integration with backend services
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### Environment Configuration

- API Base URL: `/api`
- Auth0 Redirect URI: `http://4.156.37.48/`

## Deployment Process

The frontend was deployed using a multi-stage Docker build process:

1. **Build Stage**:
   - Used Node.js 18 Alpine as the base image
   - Installed dependencies with `npm ci`
   - Built the application with `npm run build`

2. **Production Stage**:
   - Used NGINX Alpine as the base image
   - Copied the built application from the build stage
   - Configured NGINX to serve the application and proxy API requests

3. **Deployment**:
   - Built a multi-platform Docker image using Docker Buildx
   - Pushed the image to Docker Hub
   - Updated the Kubernetes deployment to use the new image
   - Applied the changes to the cluster

## Accessing the Application

The application is accessible at:

http://4.156.37.48/

## Maintenance

To update the frontend:

1. Make changes to the frontend code
2. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy-optimized-frontend.sh
   ```
3. The script will build a new image, push it to Docker Hub, and update the deployment

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the frontend:

1. Check the pod status:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n microservices -l app=frontend
   ```

2. Check the pod logs:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n microservices -l app=frontend
   ```

3. If necessary, delete the pod to force a restart:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod -n microservices -l app=frontend
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Configure SSL/TLS for secure access
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
3. Implement monitoring and alerting for the frontend
